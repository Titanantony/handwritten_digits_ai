Handwritten Digit Recognizer with Neural Networks

# Handwritten Digits Recognition

This project trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Model

The trained model is saved in the `handwritten_model.keras` file.

Due to the file size, the model is stored in cloud storage. You can download the model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W8oO82WJyGjQQ1Tqs0E0lIr3LCf2y677/view?usp=sharing)

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Titanantony/handwritten_digits_ai.git
   cd handwritten_digits_ai
